# Mathematics but simplified

This repo is created for explaining math topics in a simpler and educating way.
Note: Some basic topics like arithmetic, pre-algebra etc. has two variations. **Children and Adult.**
You can choose one variations varied on your age.
Children version has variable design depends on the age (like as 5-9 is different, 9-11 is different etc...) whereas Adult version has a clear and modern design (fixed). Screenshots will be added.
